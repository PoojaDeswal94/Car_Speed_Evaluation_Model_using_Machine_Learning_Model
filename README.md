# Car_Speed_Evaluation_Model_using_Machine_Learning

# The Problem Statement
The problem is to predict the safety of the car. In this project, I build a Random Fores t Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I implement Random Forest Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn. I have used the Car Evaluation Data Set for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

The dataset can be found at the following url-

# Aim:
The aim of this project is to predict the safety of the car. In this project, I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the safety of the car using Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn.

I also built a Random Forest Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I have implemented Random Forest Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn.

The dataset used here is the Car Evaluation Data Set, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

# Dataset description
I have used the Car Evaluation Data Set downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. The data set can be found at the following url:-

Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for expert system for decision making. The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

It was donated by Marko Bohanec.
